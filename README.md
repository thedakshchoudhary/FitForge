# Fit Forge - Fitness Tracker using AI 


## About

A comprehensive fitness coaching platform that allows create workout plans for you, track progress, and access a vast exercise database with
detailed instructions and video demonstrations.

## 🎯 Project Origin & Motivation

This project was born from a personal mission to revive and improve upon a previous fitness platform. As the **primary contributor** to the
original [workout.lol](https://github.com/workout-lol/workout-lol) project, I witnessed its journey and abandonment. 🥹

### The Story Behind **_workout.cool_**

- 🏗️ **Original Contributor**: I was the main contributor to workout.lol
- 💼 **Business Challenges**: The original project faced major hurdles with exercise video partnerships (no reliable video provider) could
  be established
- 💰 **Project Sale**: Due to these partnership issues, the project was sold to another party
- 📉 **Abandonment**: The new owner quickly realized that **exercise video licensing costs were prohibitively expensive**, began to be sick
  and abandoned the entire project
- 🔄 **Revival Attempts**: For the past **9 months**, I've been trying to reconnect with the new stakeholder
- 📧 **Radio Silence**: Despite multiple (15) attempts, there has been no response
- 🚀 **New Beginning**: Rather than let this valuable work disappear, I decided to create a fresh, modern implementation

### Why **_workout.cool_** Exists

**Someone had to step up.**

The opensource fitness community deserves better than broken promises and abandoned platforms.

I'm not building this for profit.

This isn't just a revival : it's an evolution. **workout.cool** represents everything the original project could have been, with the
reliability, modern approach, and **maintenance** that the fitness open source community deserves.

## 👥 From the Community, For the Community

**I'm not just a developer : I'm a user who refused to let our community down.**

I experienced firsthand the frustration of watching a beloved tool slowly disappear. Like many of you, I had workouts saved, progress
tracked, and a routine built around the platform.

### My Mission: Rescue & Revive.

_If you were part of the original workout.lol community, welcome back! If you're new here, welcome to the future of fitness platform
management._

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Copy environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Set up PostgreSQL database**

   - If you don't already have it, install PostgreSQL locally
   - Create a database named `workout_cool` : `createdb -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres workout_cool`

4. **Run database migrations**

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

5. **Seed the database (optional)**

See the - [Exercise database import section](#exercise-database-import)

6. **Start the development server**

## Exercise Database Import

The project includes a comprehensive exercise database. To import a sample of exercises:

### Prerequisites for Import

1. **Prepare your CSV file**

Your CSV should have these columns:

```
id,name,name_en,description,description_en,full_video_url,full_video_image_url,introduction,introduction_en,slug,slug_en,attribute_name,attribute_value
```

You can use the provided example.

### Import Commands

```bash
# Import exercises from a CSV file
pnpm run import:exercises-full /path/to/your/exercises.csv

# Example with the provided sample data
pnpm run import:exercises-full ./data/sample-exercises.csv
```

### CSV Format Example

```csv
id,name,name_en,description,description_en,full_video_url,full_video_image_url,introduction,introduction_en,slug,slug_en,attribute_name,attribute_value
157,"Fentes arrières à la barre","Barbell Reverse Lunges","<p>Stand upright...</p>","<p>Stand upright...</p>",https://youtube.com/...,https://img.youtube.com/...,slug-fr,slug-en,TYPE,STRENGTH
157,"Fentes arrières à la barre","Barbell Reverse Lunges","<p>Stand upright...</p>","<p>Stand upright...</p>",https://youtube.com/...,https://img.youtube.com/...,slug-fr,slug-en,PRIMARY_MUSCLE,QUADRICEPS

## Project Architecture

This project follows **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)** principles with Next.js App Router:

```
src/
├── app/ # Next.js pages, routes and layouts
├── processes/ # Business flows (multi-feature)
├── widgets/ # Composable UI with logic (Sidebar, Header)
├── features/ # Business units (auth, exercise-management)
├── entities/ # Domain entities (user, exercise, workout)
├── shared/ # Shared code (UI, lib, config, types)
└── styles/ # Global CSS, themes
```

### Architecture Principles

- **Feature-driven**: Each feature is independent and reusable
- **Clear domain isolation**: `shared` → `entities` → `features` → `widgets` → `app`
- **Consistency**: Between business logic, UI, and data layers

### Example Feature Structure

```
features/
└── exercise-management/
├── ui/ # UI components (ExerciseForm, ExerciseCard)
├── model/ # Hooks, state management (useExercises)
├── lib/ # Utilities (exercise-helpers)
└── api/ # Server actions or API calls
```
